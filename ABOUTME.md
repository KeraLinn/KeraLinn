- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @KeraLinn!

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in UI/UX design and gamification.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently completing a Computer Science Bachelor's Degree from Full Sail University. Many of my repositories will be related to my classes and class projects to demonstrate my coding ability, my high level of detail to each project, and my ability to work with others on a project.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: best way is through LinkedIn! My resume is also on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/kera-linn/
